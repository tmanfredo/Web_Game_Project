Game Project: Idle Typer
Authors: Ryan Freese, Thomas Manfredo, and Zaudan Wawhkyung

Our game is a unique variation on the game "Cookie Clicker" but for those who love typing games, tests, and other keyboard based activities. Our game is extremely intutive where the player could immediately start playing without even needing the instructions. The instructions do provide information about the game, the various upgrades, and some tips and tricks for the user to help them get going. The instructions help the user along and encourage them to do their best (with an added canvas smile to provide a friendly atmosphere :) ). 

The motivating factor for our game is to get as high as they can and to play accurately since incorrect characters typed will make them lose points. People love high scores and working to optimize these kinds of games, so it is really fun to get going and get the score high.
