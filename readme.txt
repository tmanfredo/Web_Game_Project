Game Project: Idle Typer
Authors: Ryan Freese, Thomas Manfredo, and Zaudan Wawhkyung

Our project is worth 100 points due to the many features and implementations we used. Our game is a unique variation on the game "Cookie Clicker" but for those
who love typing games, tests, and other keyboard based activities. Our game is extremely intutive where the player could immediately start playing without even needing the instructions.
The instructions do provide information about the game, the various upgrades, and some tips and tricks for the user to help them get going. The instructions help the user along
and encourage them to do their best (with an added canvas smile to provide a friendly atmosphere :) ). 

The motivating factor for our game is to get as high as they can and to play accurately since incorrect characters typed will make them lose points. People love high scores and working to
optimize these kinds of games, so it is really fun to get going and get the score high.

Some features that were difficult but fun and nifty to implement was the word upgrades and the auto-typer. The word upgrades unlocks another word slot for the player and an issue we
ran into was making the words appear on screen symetrically and also not losing track of the words already on screen. The auto-typer also allowed us to learn how to use the
setInterval() function and how we might be able to make that work well. These features really tied the game together in a fun fashion and made it really nice to play.

Overall, this project was a good balance of difficult, fun, and learning in the time span we had for the project. While there were so many features and improvements that we would have
added with a longer timeline, we are really proud of what we were able to accomplish through these couple of weeks. We hope you enjoy Idle Typer!
